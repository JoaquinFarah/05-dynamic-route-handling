      "Came for lunch with my sister. We loved our Thai-style mains which were amazing with lots of flavour, very impressive for a vegetarian restaurant. But the service was below average and the chips were too terrible to finish. When we arrived at 1.40, we had to wait 20 minutes while they got our table ready. OK, so we didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant was only half full. There was no reason to make us wait at all. We ordered the chips as a side dish and they looked delicious. But, when we tasted them, they were overcooked and swimming in oil so we left most of them. We expected a lot more for $10! When the waiter asked if everything was ok, we said we really didn't like the chips and he said 'That's funny, I love them' and that was it. He didn't offer us anything else or take them off our bill. Also, when we didn't leave a tip, he looked annoyed. I was really excited about visiting Vega, and the mains were just fantastic, but the rest of the experience was really disappointing.",

      "As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting, a delightful marriage of antique cut stones and the luxuries of modernity.  Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the workshop-like kitchen where you can see the chefs working. For those who do not book a table and are waiting, there is a cosy lounge with aged leather armchairs and pictures of polo players displayed on the walls. ",

        "I was so impressed with my breakfast this morning! I tried the Fried Green Tomato Benedict and my boyfriend got the Crab Cakes Benedict. We both finished our whole plates and were so impressed with the quality of the food and the short amount of time it took to receive it. Our waitress was sweet and helpful. I will definitely be back!",
